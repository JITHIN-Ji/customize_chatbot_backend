Its development has\nbeen shaped by key milestones, leading to its status as a leading automation tool. Over the years,\nSelenium has become a trusted solution for developers and testers due to its flexibility, cross-\nbrowser compatibility, and open-source nature. This overview is divided into two key subtopics:\nThe Origins of Selenium and The Evolution of Selenium into WebDriver.\n4.1\nTHE ORIGINS OF SELENIUM\nSelenium was first introduced in 2004 by Jason Huggins and Paul Hammant at Thought-\nWorks.

Unlike its predecessor, WebDriver worked directly with browsers, offering faster,\nmore reliable, and more flexible testing. It could interact with browser elements at a deeper level,\nmaking it ideal for testing dynamic and highly interactive web applications.\nIn 2011, Selenium Core and WebDriver were combined into Selenium 2.0, marking a major\nturning point. This merger brought the best features of both tools together, creating a powerful,\nunified framework for automated testing. Selenium 2.0 introduced cross-browser compatibility,\nparallel testing, and better support for modern web technologies, enabling testers to efficiently test\napplications on various browsers and platforms.\nWith the release of Selenium 3.0 in 2016, the framework underwent significant improve-\nments.

Online communi-\nties, forums, documentation, tutorials, and social media groups offer a wealth of knowledge\nand assistance. Engaging with the community, attending conferences, and leveraging online\ncourses can enhance skills and keep testers updated with the latest trends. Incorporating\nSelenium into a test automation framework, considering key test factors such as function-\nality, usability, performance, reliability, compatibility, security, maintainability, testability,\nscalability, and compliance, will contribute to comprehensive and effective testing. Overall,\nSelenium is a valuable tool for automating software testing, reducing testing costs, and im-\nproving test efficiency. With proper understanding, planning, and utilization, Selenium can\nsignificantly contribute to the success of software testing efforts.\n37\n",
